# Housing-Value-Crime-Rate-in-the-suburb-of-Boston
Objectives:
a) Fit classification models in order to predict whether a given suburb has a crime rate above or below the median
b) Predict the median value of the owner occupied homes (in $1,000's)

Statisical Learning Techniques:
a) Logistic Regression
b) Linear Discriminant Analysis
c) Best subset selection method, and checking for Cp, BIC, AdjR2 to minimize the test error
d) Forward and backward stepwise selection using subset apprraoch.
e) Best Subset selection and choose the best model using Validation set and Cross-validation approach (directly estimate test MSE)
f) Shrinkage Methods (Ridge Regression and Lasso)
g) Dimension Reduction (PCR & PLS)
h) Tree, Bagging, Random Forest & Gradient Boosting
